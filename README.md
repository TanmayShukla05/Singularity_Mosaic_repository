# Singularity Mosaic

A modular pipeline for generating, enhancing, and evaluating high-resolution astronomical images — focused on black hole imaging (e.g., M87).

## Folders

- **M87_image_generation** – Raw image generation from interferometric data  
- **PSF** – Point Spread Function generation and analysis  
- **image_enhancement** – Deconvolution, calibration, and adaptive weighting  
- **End-Part-of-Image-generation** – Post-processing and final image improvements  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Astropy  
- CASA (for uvfits support)
